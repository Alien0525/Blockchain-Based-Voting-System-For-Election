# Blockchain-Based-Voting-System-For-Election
A decentralized application (dapp) built with Solidity and Truffle and deployed on the blockchain (Ethereum based Ropsten test network). Frontend is built using HTML, CSS (bootstrap) and JavaScript. The votes cast by people are stored on a public blockchain which makes the election process highly secure, immutable, transparent, anonymous, fast and cost-effective.

Blockchain can serve a unique role in preventing government corruption. Its technology offers a singular combination of permanent and tamper-evident record keeping, real-time transaction transparency and auditability, and automated smart contract functionality.
